### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm **Lucas PREZELIN**âš¡currently the Business Development Manager of [OKP4](https://okp4.network/)

After several years of developing my skills in business development applied to the agricultural sector, I quickly became interested in innovation and in particular in the contribution of new disruptive technologies.

Today, I put my experience, my curiosity and my agility at the service of the web3 by actively participating in the development of OKP4 which opens the doors to a new world, the knowledge economy.

OKP4 - The Open Knowledge Protocol for Everything & Everyone
